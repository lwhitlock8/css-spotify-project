# Motivation
As three music lovers, we wanted to dive into Coachella's lineup data and investigate the collection of artists. Our two main objectives, contributing to our main goal, is to discover how artists that perform at Coachella several times become more/less popular when they return to the stage, and to determine if there is a difference in sentiment in songs acrross the years.

Our network analysis aims to uncover artists that have performed at Coachella multiple times, and if they have gained/lost popularity.  Check out the **Network Analysis** section of this webpage, to learn more!

Our text analysis aims to determine if there is a difference in sentiment in songs acrross the years.Due to a limitation with the API for our textual data, we narrowed down our goal for the text analysis, focusing only on songs of artists that performed on the *Main Stage*.
