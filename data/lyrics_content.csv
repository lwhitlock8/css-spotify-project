16,4391000,"The Heart's Lonley Hunter Lyrics

The Truth is unspoken, a promise is broken
I'm under surveillance, they know what my name is
I need some protection, some love and affection
There's 1000 reasons, but one is the number

Welcome to my spaceship
It's beautiful forever
She's right here where you left her
And the heart's lonely hunter

Save bottles of water and flour and sugar
Turn off the AC and hang up the bed sheets
Cover up windows, careful where the light goes
Yank out the cable and blow out the candle

(Ursula Rucker)
F**k. kill. and prosper
is the gospel of Wonderland, where
street sands, are quick.
to suck you down to the abyss
with the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks
of the niggaz? Never. Nosferatu's
Those witches and warlocks in blue
Government gumshoe, keepers of the First Zoo
Who? . Me? .
I'm the modern day vixen vampire slayer
Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest
to see who ""Gets Money""
No milk and honey, in this land
cause justice has been banned
So it's play dirty or die by the hand
that's holding all the guns
Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision
To save me and my daughter's lives, but
I can't thrive off spirit and scripture
The picture grew clearer; I made the move to rear her
in a life wanting for nothing
so I got into this drug thing
Not doing, but dealing
Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds
of the doomed became my mission
Izm was just too small time
I had to find the best design to
f**k with the massive motherf**kers minds, and pockets
So I sold? kits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits

I'm so hard headed, I never listen
That's why I cut class everyday it felt like prison
Poppin' at your ex-girlfriend in detention
Tossed her in the library got my duck sick then
The next day I was jalapeno dick pissin'
Raw (that need?) the vixen on a suicide mission
Bad bussiness the pussy had me mystified
Couldn't trust her but I risked my life
Bad business my dog as my witness
Tried to act church girl religious
She had a hit list
Bad business lucky what if syphillis
Or the monster
What you got that all for a boo?

(Phesto Dee)
That's bad business
Spendin' all your time wastin' your time
That's bad bidness that's bad bidness
Yeah what do we have behind curtain
Number three, ghetto fantasy
Young buck sixteen, in a state of emergency
Got you thrown in juvenile hall
Cause you toss a marked car it's stupid
Fit out a Lakeshore
But you wanna bounce over the hill to thirteen?
That's bad bidness
Ten dollar genocide is senseless
You wanna be a pharmacist?
All you doin' is harming us
What about Paris Robinson
Medgar Evers and Huey
They kicked you out of Oakland High
Now you cuttin' up your doobie
You'll be the butt of a few jokes
Like Joey Buttafuoco, don't goof up
And let your youth go lil' bro
That's bad business

Mind your business
Man these niggas be foolish
Trippin'
Mind your business

Thoughts of deadin' me inevitably put you ahead of me
I'm steadily battering your chicanery
With battery after battery blast your smattering
To smithereens, y'all ain't as tough as y'all appear to be
Kinda queer to me (Hi!) soft lyrically, scared of triggery
Get to steppin' 'cause I'm quick to check 'em with the Heckler
In the chip and peppers restin' next to my pecker

I stress the maximum effort, I can't relax 'cause I'm reppin'
So face the fact that I'm fresher and take it back to the essence
With my spectacular methods of slayin' tracks with a vengeance
Send 'em packin' when attacked with an immaculate sentence
It's Tajai

Let me introduce myself, my name is A-Plus
No need to check 'em, I got big ol' ape nuts
I'm in love with hip-hop, it ain't lust
Whenever we drop, people they thank us
Can't stand rapper a talkin' shit but can't bust
The flamethrower hit 'em up and makes dust
Tell 'em fold, I'm workin with a straight flush
Get to steppin' before you miss the late bus

You lame fucks wanna get your frame touched

things can go bad

sitting on the dashboard of my car
it comes in colors pink and pleasant
it glows in the dark cause it's iridescent
I'll take it with me whenever I go far
so give me my lady Madonna
dressed in rhinestones and sitting on a
pedestal of abalone shells
driving 90 but I'm not scared
'cause I've got my Virgin Mary
assuring me that I will never go to hell

And by the way You know that
hope will make you strange
Make you blink, make you blank, make you sink
It will make you afraid of change
And often blame
The box with the view of the world
And the walls that fill the frame

Because I can't stand when they start to talk
About the hurting and killing
Whose shoes are we filling
The damage and ruin

And like always I'm kicking it live
Wanna call the fellas to see if they is with this
Gonna get down with the sounds of big breakfast
Start off the day with some Bob Marley
Back to the woods for that fresh parlay
Maybe even spark a little Nicki J.
And then it's off to center city in the fastest way
Cause if you've gotta get downtown real quick
Then the only way to go is I-76
Unless of course you wanna take that scenic view
Then East or West River Drive is right for you
But if you ain't got any time to lose
Put the pedal to the metal for that voyage cruise
And get on down to I-76
Because in 1996 there ain't no
Tricks in the mix

G. Love:
Back in 1982
Man it was real cool
and in school
If we got good grades
And straight up A's
Our parents would take us to a 76ers game
I got my game and there ain't no shame
Big shots for Mo Cheeks
And Moses Malone

We play the songs that sound more like everyone else, than anyone else (Klon)
Hey, alright, it's Kip Kasper, Klon Radio, LA's infinite repeat
How we feelin' out there? How's your drive-time commute?
I need a saga. What's the saga?
It's ""Songs for the Deaf""
You can't even hear it

Dead bull with the life from the low
I'll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core

67,2810023,"I'm fallin' up flights of stairs
Scrapin' myself from the sidewalk
Jumpin' from rivers to bridges
Drownin' in pure air

Hip hop is lyin' on the side of the road
Half dead to itself
Blood scrawled over its mangled flesh like jazz
Stuffed into an over sized record bag

Tuba lips swollen beyond recognition
Diamond-studded teeth strewn like rice at Karma's wedding
The ring bearer bore bad news
Minister of Information wrote the wrong proclamation

An' now everyone's singin' the wrong song
Dissonant chords find necks like nooses
That nigga kicked the chair from under my feet
Harlem shakin' from a rope but still on beat

Damn, that loop is tight
That nigga found a way to sample the way the truth the light
Can't wait to play myself at the party tonight
Niggas are gonna die

Cop car swerves to the side of the road
Hip hop takes its last breath
The cop scrawls vernacular manslaughter on a yellow pad
Then balls the paper into his hand decidin' he'd rather freestyle

[saul williams]
Through meditation i program my heart
To beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation
*saul beatboxes* ""ohm""
I burn seven day candles that melt
Into twelve inch circles on my mantle
And spin funk like myrrh
*saul beatboxes* ""ohm""
And i can fade worlds in and out with my mixing patterns
Letting the earth spin as i blend in saturn
Niggaz be like spinning windmills, braiding hair
Locking, popping, as the sonic force
Of the soul keeps the planets rocking
The beat don't stop when, soulless matter blows

In order to give birth to me
My style is black hole
Most niggas simply sound like earth to me
If hip hop were the moon i'd be the first to bleed
Cyclical sacraments of self for all my peers to read
I recite the user night??? the light for you to read by
Have you floating on cloud nine without you realizing it's my mind's sky
And the ground on which you walk is the tounge with which i walk
I speak the seas, i root the trees of suburbia and new york
City streets can never claim me, that's why i never sound like you
All y'all niggas claim the streets as if paths through the woods aint true
You better walk the path, you better do the math
Cuz your screw face will only make the buddah laugh
Even if you know the lessons you don't know the half
But don't take it from me
Son, take a bath

Plastered in the gaze of notice eviction

When we borrow your shit, you better hit the deck
You'll walk the plank for your dis
Respect, respect, respect...
If you front on the Rock, best run and hide
If you got static, we'll take it outside
And you start to get dulled by the Beastie Boys
Use real rock beats, show off big toys
Like claps of thunder from the cumulus clouds
So we'll pump up the beat and make it real loud
Loud...

That friends like mine will never let you down

100,6474592,"I remember back in high school
Getting high was tons of fun
It's much easier to score some weed than to drink
Before you're twenty-one

At that age, I thought alcohol was square
Drinking's something just old folks do
'Course if we got our hands on some, well hell
We'll drink like old folks too

It's different now when you get older
And you're gettin' on in your years
I've become so much more civilized
Since movin' on to spirits and beers

So today if I wanna act an ass
And gag, puke, stagger and fall
I'm gonna do it at the trusted hands
Of Good Ol' Alcohol

That Good Ol' Alcohol
One more before last call
Can make you feel a mile high
If you've been feeling small
Yes, every now and then
I'll call upon my friend
That Good Ol', Good Ol', Good Ol'
Alcohol

When I younger, my thing was hippy drugs
Like hashish, caps and lids
Had dugout with ZoSo written on it
Where I kept my one-hitter hid

Amphetamine just wasn't my speed
And cocaine would make you go broke
But man o' man I sure could go for that
Marijuana smoke

I'd use a bong or bowl or rollin' papers
Or any other smoke component
Then I'd rip right through two boxes of
Entenmann's coffee cake covered donuts

And if you found yourself stranded
With no paraphernalia at all
You could always poke some holes
Through empty cans of alcohol

That Good Ol' Alcohol
Finds you in the bathroom stall
With your face inside the toilet
Curled up in a little ball
Yet, once you've done my friend
You'll come runnin' back again
For some Good Ol', Good Ol', Good Ol'
Alcohol

She stumbled, started to slip and fall
Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes

""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you""
Maybe for you, now

But not as shaky as I must have seemed
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak
For a sec', I thought I sounded sweet
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak

Gonna wrap you up tight
Gonna play with the braids
That you came here with tonight
I'm gonna hold your face
And toast the snow that fell
'Cause friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell

I feel like love is in your kitchen
With a culinary eye
I think he's making something special
And I'm smart enough to try
If you don't trust yourself
For at least a moment each day
Well, will you trust in this girl?
'Cause loving is coming our way

If you fix me up, girl

Constant quarreling, the childish fits, and our clothes in a pile on the ottoman.
All the slander and double-speak
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof was your lips touching mine in the photobooth.

And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will put your hard heart away.
You were so condescending...
And this is all that's left:
Scraping paper to document.
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on.

I'm dressed up for free drinks
And family greetings on your wedding
Your wedding, your wedding day
The figures in plastic
On the wedding cake
That I took
Were so real

And I kept a distance
The complications cloud
The postcards and blips through fibre optics
As the girls with the pigtails
Were running from little boys wearing bow ties
Their parents bought them
I'll catch you this time

Crashing through the parlour doors

But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not not making me wait,
But it seems alright as long as something's happening

I try to make you late,
But you fight me out like a fire does
You try making me wait,

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

No honestly you know too much so leave us, leave us on our own

And told like a novel length story
Something like ""The Lord of The Rings"" or something like that

They are smeared and these blurs come in random order
And they color the eyes of your former lovers
Hers were green like July,

The work solution makes the common house a home
The element of progress that you mention's gone
It de-evolved to something you were headed toward

Did I waste my time? I think I did
I worked for life

Our work makes pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow, like a father's dream

The pain was gone the instant she cleared her throat to speak her name
Said, ""Both of us must suffer from the same unendin' ache""

The world was not of interest, though her days were never dull
Her bed beneath a crucifix on guests performin' miracles
With the son of God just hangin' like a common criminal

I am with God

What if I feel lost
I am not

They'll sell them for nothing, a cheap watch or locket
That kind of gold just washes off

They long to ring bells of warning to tell of their coming
So the pure can shut their doors

The angry are animals, all senseless and savage
They act without order in logical lapses

181,670431,"The city has sex with itself I suppose
As the concrete collides while the scenery grows
And the lonely once bandaged lay fully exposed
Having undressed their wounds for each other

And there's a boy in a basement with a four track machine
He's been strumming and screaming all night down there
The tape hiss will cover the words that he sings
But they say it's better to bury your sadness
In a graveyard or garden that waits for the spring
To awake from its sleep and burst into green

Well, I've cried
And you think I'd feel better for it

Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess that changed my mind

And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The song maker says, ""It ain't so bad""
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down""
It's all in your mind

192,120656224,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

193,101029845,"I was sitting safely across the road
From a rusting scaffolding picking my nose
When a bird spoke up from high on that dark neon
He said, ""I bet there're some things that you should come clean up""

Oh, I didn't know
Oh where to begin
Like you do not know
Oh, I set the emotion

I was beating up babies, babies I mean
That don't look like babies, but they're babies to me
I was looking around for my very own best friend
Couldn't help feeling things would come to an end

Ineloquence and anger

Like Saturn's rings
An icy loop around me
Too hard to hold

Lash out first
At all the things we don't like

And It's Beginning To Get To Me
That I know more of the stars and sea
Than I do of what's in your head
Barely touching in our cold bed

The organ grinders had the whole thing planned.
Take his tongue and remove his two eyeballs.
Savin' em up for the day if that guy calls.
I'm almost certain, but this is speculation,
The notes are in a box marked ""Christmas Decorations"".
Remember what I told ya to do with the hair gel,
And don't let anyone see you in the stairwell.
Tell the key cutter I said to stay home.
I'll call him at quarter after twelve from a pay phone.
Make sure whoever stays the night has a dental plan.
The girls already came through with the rental van.
Shave all the hair on your body and bathe.
The convoy will be at the border by morning.
Take the appetite suppressants at sunrise.
Over-exerting tonight would be unwise.
We'll all be wearing the matching necklaces.
Double check everything; There's no room for recklessness.
Burn the clothes I was wearing on Wednesday.
Pay no attention to what your so-called friends say.
Bury the screwdriver set in the playground.
The blood donor said he needs a half-hour to lay down.
Only ever sign for parcels if you know the guys.

Butane?
Check.

207,1194839,"Sky diver, your pants are on fire and the rest of your clothes
is blowing
And for some strange reason, your nose is growing
My skin is crawling, everybody's chin is falling,
jaws are dropping left and right
Lost cause you came like a thief in the night
With nice white teeth and a tight ass and long conversation
Fascinating feeling to spend months in your company
I never felt uncomfortable, even with my clothes off
Chillin so hard, my ass almost froze off
Everybody shows off and wants to look presentable
But the fact of the matter is that accidents are preventable
From the sound of the candy wrappers
Down to the handicappers
Everybody's got to exercise a little caution
But every so often expect things to get hectic or
Technically difficult and I begin to get skeptical
Especially when the canadian bacon gets sizzlin
Isn't it a sin when the ceiling is invisible

by day carry a net.
With no strings attached,
to a magic marionette.

See there's so little time left
and yet there's so much space.
Thinking why don't you give me a call later on
so we can touch base.

I swim across the seven seas,
and follow the sounds of handclaps.
And just try to keep my balls

We fantastic, flippin on tracks like gymnastics
Small brats get they ass kicked, me and Mos smash it
Top gun like what comes after the, fist rockin' knife
Check the keys that get played on the roads of life
Yo the rhyme is so heavy like a load of my chest
Travel on these mc's, leave 'em broken like house pets
Priceless like the streets I'm on, my word is born
You like Paula Abdul-ka-ka compared to Sarah Born?
Sayin, what did I do to be so black and blue
Mc's sayin damn what got it goin after you
Slam my microphone and do just what I have to do
Aiyyo, I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through
You know I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through

(Mos Def)
I'm on my way back to Louis Avenue
Inside Brooklyn the b-boy capital, lot of cats travel to black eratical
Say, my response is invatically yes
We invatically fresh, you dramatically stressed
These mc's proceed to cease the presidential palace
And burn Babylon like a?
Strive to maintain balance
With the God given talent
Articulate the article, eliminate the fossical
Black Star Line shine remarkable, they style ain't even talkable
These socalled criminals is fictional they make the party turn miserable
We document the memorable
Then break 'em up like syllables
Straight down to earth like minerals
Your style is foul like down? chemicals
We five-dimensional, audio, visual, physical, spiritual, lyrical
Another world

Just look at ya, together
You, you little black stovepipe colored nigga
You are the same complexion as Marcus Garvey
The man that brought self love
to the black consciousness movement of the 1930s
And now when we speak about complexion
We move into (?) of where y'all comin from
Yeah, red boned, variety covered

See, cuz you are tellin the truth

Yeah, we bout to do it all over again
Here we go

A lotta cats like to get on the microphone and front
They say they rollin the paper like they ran outta blunts
Tell ya how much the Soundscan of the month
The man tell you to just do it
We never let the man take advantage of us
You get props off the diamonds you rented
I get my props off the rhymes I invented
Cuz I spoke my mind and I meant it
Like Tae Bo with a bow tie, kicked your ass with class
And we still take it to Brooklyn when we ready to splash
Me and Hi-Tek got you ready to blast
I'm all ready to last, I stay hungry like I'm ready to fast
Married to the movement like a (?)
The rhyme veteran
You actin real bitch right now like a lesbian thespian

my neighborhood.
And if my parents are crying
then I'll dig a tunnel
from my window to yours,
yeah a tunnel from my window to yours.
You climb out the chimney
and meet me in the middle,
the middle of town.
And since there's no one else around,
we let our hair grow long
and forget all we used to know,
then our skin gets thicker

Didn't wanna fight my own worst enemy
Wipe me out, did it all from view
Destroyed myself, became more like you

I'm making plans, I know I won't keep
Spinning, spinning secrets that she told me
Day drunk on the beach, with all my friends
Think I, think I might just sober up again

And the blue in the sky, well, it looks so dope

Always been about what I want
Listen to me while I preach
Never been the kind to make much space for emotions in a fight
Anything I didn't wanna hear, I just preached 'til I was right
But you, you got me on the line
Told me that you think it's time
Make a change or this is gonna stall
Shape up, or you'll drop me like a call
Now I wanna write a love song even though you never ever asked me for one
Write you letters and sweet poems
Ask for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, rein my pride in, start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second let me U-turn

I dreamt I met with Behan
I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day
When questioned on his views
On the crux of life's philosophies
He had but these few clear and simple words to say

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn
Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me

It's all in my hands to repent
Spectacular sin that take discipline to stop

Ellis is hardly a fiend

Do you know where the worlds going to go?
I don't know if you do

Many happy people woke and cried

You wake upon that snowy day when no one is prepared for it

Star fruit so simple and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
How could I feel so-so when I'm feeling like a little honey can roll
Tart but not total and I'm feeling like a little honey can roll

When I was young I thought fruit was an infinite thing
I'd be sad to wake up and find all of my cherries are charred or they're rotted to ruin

It seems we all can't last
Oh Pink Lady your days so distinguished are a movement so fluid
So smooth against my palm
Reminisce of the days when they all praised your sweet Red Delicious

When a farmer picks a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)
Then a kid he picks a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)
Then a chef she makes a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)
Then a mayor eats a good thing (When you think you don't know you don't know what comes next)

Ripe and whole we can move outside us

Take for me take for me pictures of valleys with lemons hung
Dangling dangling they will be released every little piece does make a one
Brown on the ground can you show me a way I can simplify

Held up in a luxury suite, behind a barricaded door

My clone wears a brown shirt,

Bring it on like a storm, till I knock the wind out of his sails
And we don't make eye contact, when we have run-in's in town

Yes, I'm livin for the funk like I was Lord Finesse
Last night I screamed till I lost my voice I guess
Had a few things left to get up off of my chest
Like I'm, facing the fact that I'm not, what my mom wanted
Only gold plaque that I got, had the Qu'Ran on it
I fliped your eviction notice over, wrote a song on it
Like to hear it, here it go, light your spirit, clear your soul
If I would've known that tonight was Ladie's Night
I would've stopped and swabbed my balls with the baby whipe
In the van, Hold your sorry little life in my hand
Watch me toss it in the sky and swing right for the stands
Battling me is like trying to ride your bike in the sand
I'ma eat one more helping, then I'm, whiping my hands
And you frustrated rappers, must hate the fact
That I walk in first class, have so much ladies gaspin for breath
Tryin to catch me, with the ass and the chest
I ain't tryin to be rude lady, I'm just passin a test
Got enough hastle and stress, with one woman cashing my cheques
I'll take the compliment and pass on the sex

We like
Brother Brother Brother, how ya making 'em get down
Come, straight to your town, vibrating the ground
Keep the people out there scared, of making a sound
Thats our policy, we step out there on Star Quality
Brother Brother Brother, how ya making 'em get down
Come, straight to your town, vibrating the ground
Keep the people out there scared, of making a sound
Thats our policy, we step out there

You ain't hardcore, you soft more than Shamar Moore
In a tight shirt sayin 'Let's slow this train down ya'll'
You stink hoes, spills a whole, lot of nothing
Got the nerve to look Ox in the eye, you got it coming
While your woman nod her face to the beat, you tasting defeat
Whiping the waste from my cleets, between the space in your teeth

Now me smiling ear to ear now that's something to see, shit

Good Lord Ya'll
I said my life, and my God and my songs

Man no question use to always know that I was crazy
Guess it's safe to say I came a long way baby
Mama throwing dishes at my ex-wife bitching at me
never did envision daddy could be this happy, shit
To me not broke is rich
Got a two bedroom a new sofa to sit
For the first time ain't go to Good Will or St. Steven's
But IKEA put that boy together last weekend
Out in NY I met a fly Puerto Rican
Dimed out sales girl Victoria's Secret
Took her on a train to Pennsylvaina for a weekend
that's eighteen months ago dog, guess where she been?

Got to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee

Songs that make me feel like I'm already free
I'm a rebel in my own right

Put the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be

Listen to all the voices
And tell me what you hear
Is it right or wrong
Just to sit and wait
(wait for someone else to wait for someone else)
You push your body to the knife
But it feels as if you hesitate

Gotta get away lover,
Just a place to crawl away
Is this a love or just a fear?
What if there were traces
Shots of different faces follow me

I keep you close enough to know
That I am never alone
I disappear within the night
Though I act as if I'm coming home

Gotta get away lover,
Just a place to crawl away

Two silhouetted worlds collide
I wished upon a shooting star
Don't I always wonder where you are

And then it came a crashing down
I stood frozen in the moment, blinded by the light
Bless my soul tonight

Hands up who can touch the sky
Won't you feed me to the wolves instead?

Hay un loquito suelto que a las niñas provoca
Se viste y se perfuma como hace un buen muchacho
Y cuando hay muchas chicas se vuelve un mamarracho

El se les va acercando con mucha simpatía
Como si fuera un tonto las niñas se confían
Y si esa muchachita muy sola está bailando
No espera mucho tiempo y se acerca sobando

Y soba que soba y soba. Ay, el Sobon
Y soba que soba y soba. Ay, el Sobon
Y soba que soba y soba. Ay el Sobon

Yo le digo a las nenas que vayan con cuidado
Porque este joven anda muy disimulado
Si tienen su pareja a el nunca le ha importado
Para este tipo de cosas el viene preparado

No le teme a los novios ni que carguen espada
Y mucho más disfruta con las niñas casadas
Si tu no le has hablado ten mucha precaucion
Porque al muy descarado le dicen Sobon

Y soba que soba y soba. Ay, el Sobon

but i thought of it so
like there's no other way it could've been done
well, lay aside my fear,
for a puzzle i wish not to play a part in it
a heart stained in hate,
a feeling of fear will play circles
But you, you were my favorite
but you, you know, you were my favorite
I severed my ties
to shroud this body under the streets of this city
and wait for the day
when i am summoned to walk across the face
well, slowly but clearer now,
in visiouns that play and plague memories
i loved them with all
all as the son should to mother and father
But you, you were my favorite

No World For Tomorrow
The Road And The Damned
I believe in the world right in front of me,
but now, along these empty streets
where this curse holds these memories of a man,
you know he's lost.

No time to think about it. No room to breathe.

If I had a way back, I'd ride through the dark and the door
(but please don't wait for me)
because the man you love don't live anymore.

325,30803656,"She wheezes out her dying wish.
Come closer. One more moment, one more kiss
And I love her, I give her all I can
Her body sinks, her heat released
The curtain swings, this time she leaves
I will remember all she's done for me
But only I forgot that I'm not ready to let her go
As all time moves, you'll be riddled with doubt
You'll mourn to pull through, but love is dangerous

When skeletons live inside your closets, thick and thin
you'll fear that no one will hear us sing our songs
The truth is relevant, but not for long
'Cause love is our downfall

I'm sorry this life cuts out everything
and leaves you to scrounge for nothing

Oh this has become hell
How can I share this life with someone else

There is no weight that can bury us
Beneath the ghosts of all my guilt

Made of our cozy decomposing wires

When fire starts to matter and the clock's still churning
Cliches and other chatter keeps our minds from learning

As you turn away
Posture and grace, I love to watch you crawl

Keep me conjuring, cause you should be alive
You'll be out of it cause you live a lie
Alone

No one laughs at God in a war
No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor

No one laughs at God when the doctor calls after some routine tests
No one's laughing at God
When it's gotten real late and their kid's not back from the party yet

No one laughs at God when their airplane start to uncontrollably shake
No one's laughing at God
When they see the one they love, hand in hand with someone else
And they hope that they're mistaken

No one laughs at God
When the cops knock on their door and they say we got some bad news, sir
No one's laughing at God when there's a famine or fire or flood

My brain and tongue just met
And they ain't friends so far
My words don't travel far
They tangle in my hair
And tend to go nowhere
They grow right back inside
Right past my brain and eyes
Into my stomach juice
Where they don't serve much use
No healthy calories
Nutrition values
And I absorb back in
The words right through my skin
They sit there festering
Inside my bowels
The consonants and vowels
The consequence of sounds
The consonants and vowels
The consequence of sounds

Got a soundtrack in my mind
All the time
Kids screamin' from too much beat up
And they don't even rhyme
They just stand there, on a street corner
Skin tucked in and meat side out and shouting
I'd like to turn 'em down
But there ain't no knob
Born into picket fences
Not into picket lines
All this hippie shit's for the '60s
and a cliché in our times, but
What if one of these days your heart
Will just stop ticking
And they sort of just don't find you
Till your cubicle is reeking?

She's reading in the bedroom
The dog is in the yard
And I just got back from traveling hard

I've been ten days gone
I've been ten days gone 'cross the sea
With my girl in a house in the trees
I love her she knows
But sometimes my love goes
'Cross the sea

Paulette is in the garden

No man is a fool
When he finds himself a woman
And she helps him carry through

Love can give you pain
Love can dig you ditches
Get your wheels stuck in the rain

Somewhere in between
Alive
And living a dream
No peace
Just clicking machines
In the quiet of compazine
The walls caved in on me

And she sings
My bird dressed in white
And she stings
My arm in the night
I lay still
Still I'm ready to fight
Have my lungs
But you can't take my sight
And the walls caved in tonight

Out here
I watch the sun circle the earth
The marrows collide in rebirth
In God's glory praise
The spirit calls out from the caves

We're not there, we're not halfway there

We were running 'round
And that was when we heard music
What we had in common where we thought we're going In a misty morning
Just overflowing with music
On the answering machine there's a familiar voice so easily recognized
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
And I'll be there

Music on the windscreen of my dreams
Music in the dark end of the street
Every time there's music
It's gonna be all or nothing at all

A long time ago
'Cause I'd heard some song I used to hear back then

I remember when, even further back
In another town
'Cause I saw something written I used to say back then
Hard to comprehend

And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree
I laugh more often now, I cry more often now
I am more me

But of course some days I just lie around
And hardly exist
And can't tell apart what I'm eating

Upon the gallery wall, they take the world apart

Send lighting to your mind

He knows everyone
And he says ""Start a revolution without me
I'll definitely be at the next one""

Oh oh oh oh

On a leash, by the reigns
Got a look that puts me in chains

I shamed my family, shamed my home

He's just waiting for a pardon

All the white boys in their Sta-Prest slacks
Home for the summer from college
They stayin' out late getting rowdy at the bars
Looking for trouble uptown

I caught a cab

Ran up a tab

Missed my son's graduation

Punched the Nichols boy

Natural disasters on the evening news

Still things could be much worse
We still got our health

Without the worry of tomorrow
And comets fell from the sky
I took your breath, you took my sorrow

You walked sad in a dream
But count your days, boy, they are fading
You set a fire in my heart

One chance in a lifetime was worth the waiting

Let us go easy as we watch them hit the ground
When the light is gone, the memory of nothings left to sound

Memories, sweet whispers are all that we'll have left
So fall into these arms tonight and share this one last breath

I know it's somewhere in the past

There's a girl out there who's lookin' for it too
She's not sure when she'll go or exactly what she'll do
If I am doomed, am I the first one or the last?
Am I just someone from the past?

No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean
And sun are always there
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
Of the darkness

If I ever saw a ghost, it'd change the way I think
I wouldn't gasp for air if ever I did sink
I wouldn't struggle, I'd just let it all out fast
And then start living in the past

No one has to hear (if we hold the hand that saves the hand)
The sound of people laughing at their fear (and everyone can feel the hand)
And the ocean (and nothing's gonna change)

In a city where there's nobody else around
And I know it's been a little awhile
But your number is the only one I found

Now we've had our share of ups and downs
In the years I came through your town
But let's put it all to rest
And let's just have a night of one on one
When the conversations have begun
Just put your head on my chest

And you grab hold of my hand as I whisper in your ear

So sad to see you torn apart

Oh but something about the whole thing

Home is where beds are made and butter is added to toast
On a cold afternoon you can float room to room like a ghost
Take the creche out and argue 'bout who gets to set up the kings
And I know that it's home because that's where the stereo sings

I've got dreams, dreams to remember
But not even home will be with you forever

It's Christmas time and the plane flies me over white hills

I said forever
But it doesn't look like I'm gonna be around much anymore
When the heat gets subtropical, and the talk gets so topical

Riot act
You can read me the riot act
You can make me a matter of fact or a villain in a million
A slip of the tongue is gonna keep me civilian

Why do you talk such stupid nonsense
When my mind could rest much easier?
Instead of all this dumb, dumb insolence

Handing the keys to me in this Red Lion
Where the lock that you locked in the suite says, ""There's no prying""

The street screams, ""There's no science""

When you look how you looked, then to me
Then I cease lying and fall into silence

513,145879422,"It's all I'm looking for
These moments of opaque-eyed knocked-out rapture
Helpless as a calf at the capture
Chosen in a frozen instant

Far away from the scabbed-out moment
Far from the flick-flick-flick of the flat-screen
Far from the poison power of cash
Green cash reeking and heating the jet stream

Oh, the sharp sweet breath, she is my daughter
Daughter of the flashing instant
Daughter of watching ""Daughters of Darkness""
On your parents' couch with your high-school boyfriend

Spinning fevered in a haze of ditch weed
Daughters of long hard skids on the ten-speed
Daughters of July rips at the land speed
Semi-freckled eternal thrasher

Feather-haloed floating hair eye-flasher
Floating like a fire in the distance
Flashing like a flush to the skin
And whispering like the wind through the rushes

Oh, no, external actor
External actor, eh-eh-eh-eh

You gotta hoist a high flag, you gotta learn how to hang
With the freaks and the hicks in the heat of the lot

My skin stepped out for my bones to dry up
for the rest of the world outside to see
You see I, bleed on the side
It's a part time thing, a private affair
I try to keep it out of the light

I must confess, I didn't recognize you tonight
dressed up like my love
And I hate these things but I always attend
A little sip of something to take off the edge
And I make my way through the ghosts in the room

That a man does to be
The very thing he perceives
Would capture your heart?
Capture your heart

What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive
And set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything
For the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desire

I was in love with you lady, but you treated me so cool
I was drivin' a Chevy 72, it had 4 on the floor, girl
A hundred twenty, it would do

And I remember Marvin Gaye
Singin' ""What's Goin' On?""

And there was a war, baby, somewhere across the sea
I don't want to go fight, girl, cause you really love me
I remember Martin Luther King
Lord, he was the man, babe, that gave us all a dream

When everyone is sleeping
Once the bands have died down
And our brothers and our sisters have gone
I feel the shaking in my sides,
Conscious and familiar
I pace some unfamiliar street
Until I pass out or calm down enough
And I can't tell you how desperate some times I've gotten

She was licking a mag, and dressed oblique
She called me baby, and was a mean lady with the song on the radio
So I told her I was rich,
then she asked could I use a dirty bitch (of course)

Then she said, 'No one loves me... neither do I'
you get what you give,
and I give goodbye
and if I should vanish
don't get caught off guard
don't hold it against me
unless it gets hard

Aaawhhha... that's right...

Well, if sex is a weapon then smash, boom, pow...

Ok to el mundo vamos a hacer una fila
Los que me quieran tirar que enseñe las axilas
Levanten los brazos
Hey! sin darse codazos
Agarren una piedra y tirenme un pedrazo
Y sigan el rastro de mi leche
Porque con esto de la calle 13
Me he clavao como a 500 evas en 2 meses
Flacas, gordas, enanas, gemelas. Siameses
Si todavía el residente a usted no lo convence
Es por que usted tiene la cabeza cerra', cuadra' como un cubo
O puede ser que tiene un tubo atravezau pol culo... uhh!
O puede ser que tu cerebro no esta preparau pa tanto jugo
Como quiera te lo empujo
Sin echarte fufu' magia negra
Sin echarte brujo como quiera te lo empujo pol culo
Saquen el embudo... uhhh!
Erecto por el recto néctar directo inyecto
Tu cerebro apesto con el puñetero dialecto
Yo detesto a los insectos

Soy lo que dejaron
Soy toda la sobra de lo que se robaron
Un pueblo escondido en la cima
Mi piel es de cuero por eso aguanta cualquier clima
Soy una fábrica de humo
Mano de obra campesina para tu consumo
Frente de frio en el medio del verano
El amor en los tiempos del cólera, mi hermano
El sol que nace y el día que muere
Con los mejores atardeceres
Soy el desarrollo en carne viva
Un discurso político sin saliva
Las caras más bonitas que he conocido
Soy la fotografía de un desaparecido
La sangre dentro de tus venas
Soy un pedazo de tierra que vale la pena
Una canasta con frijoles
Soy Maradona contra Inglaterra anotándote dos goles
Soy lo que sostiene mi bandera
La espina dorsal del planeta es mi cordillera
Soy lo que me enseño mi padre
El que no quiere a su patria no quiere a su madre.
Soy América latina
Un pueblo sin piernas pero que camina (Oye)

Tú no puedes comprar al viento
Tú no puedes comprar al sol
Tú no puedes comprar la lluvia
Tú no puedes comprar el calor
Tú no puedes comprar las nubes
Tú no puedes comprar los colores

Tú no puedes comprar mi alegría

Tú no puedes comprar mis dolores
Tú no puedes comprar al viento
Tú no puedes comprar al sol
Tú no puedes comprar la lluvia

Emitting frequencies, lost between the leaves and things
And I held on brightly, crushing quietly
Feeling mountains rising out of make-believe seas, creating typhoons
Of feelings not easily made without need

God bless that smile on your face
God bless the seeds in the ground
God bless my family's keen gaze,
Oh, I know
That whatever happens to you,
Whatever happens to me,
I hope that I'll fall asleep
Knowing that you'll always be
The story with no ending

The whole slew blossomed beautifully,
And I was beside myself

Never cheer before you know who's winning

Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done
Someone to look to in need or in want or in war
If you give him everything, he may give you even more

Don't waste your words, they're just lies
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
And what else she got left?
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, don't forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get

I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come?
She buttoned her boot
And she straightened her suit
And she said, don't get cute
So I forced my hands in my pockets

They spoke of hell and things they knew they'd never miss.

Bridge shelter and the cold creek bed
That breaks backs and leads eyes down,
Until faces drag against the dirt
And ears living in this muddy sound.
Where the white whales roll just once a year,
And the arm feeds the hatchet with an African appetite.

Just another area
For me to patrol
Just another area
That shows I got soul

I got soul you see, I'm swimming in the De La
I'm in my hood man, my manhood worries ya
I'm known for sampling of soul food
Off the old school plates
When I met up with my niggas from the 7-1-8
One the Jungle Bro, the other Questas from Queens
Yet I had the matrix of the 516 in my genes
So I sided with my funk to bring my second on call
For me and the Sheep, our mission's on the beach of 804
(You're runnin' on an empty tank)
But still get paid in full (And get the girls)
Man, I'm packing gravitational pull
Bring the instamatic avalanche, my code intervenes
I'm out to scout the areas that remains to be seen
(What?)

Well, many many digits had me seeking in my Wizard
Man, who's ringing up my area (ooh) oh!
I used to shoe it to the bridge but that's gone
Like the 7-1-8's out of Vietnam
Sniffin' skypagers had me drugged
(Man, I knew a psycho)
7-0-3's on my love bug
I made mates with the brothers up in 2-1-5
Crazy buddhas in my mind

Well swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
And this cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the Devil can clear your mind
And strengthen your spine
But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart

Relacion: estable y no comprometida
Bebida perfecta: la cerveza fría, hey!

Y mi discurso es muy sencillo y no está escrito
Pero quien lo quiera saber yo se lo explico
Con la percusión me multiplico
Repico y repico y por eso te critico
Yo no soy fanática de la protesta
Pero sin embargo respeto tu propuesta
Es que es esa analítica que a veces apesta
Que te quejes y no hagas nada es lo que me molesta

Y así es mi raza
Mi folclor
Y esta es la cumbia que te canto yo
Y así es mi raza
Mi folclor
De bien adentro del corazón

606,87544561,"So I walked into the haze
And a million dirty ways
Now I see you lying there
Like a lie low losing air, air

Black rocks and shoreline sand
Still that summer I cannot bare
And I wipe the sand of my arms
The Spanish Sahara, the place that you'd wanna
Leave the horror here

Forget the horror here
Forget the horror here
Leave it all down here
It's future rust and then it's future dust

Forget the horror here
Forget the horror here
Leave it all down here
It's future rust and then it's future dust

Now the waves they drag you down
Carry you to broken ground

Mother of pearl, gold, and indigo
Cut through the waves, I watched you swim away

Tengo un amor de pasión
Por eso es que a otro amor

through this thunderous life, when we're not side by side

I'm roaming through the hills all alone,
I'm trying to find my direction home
A question of space, a matter of time
I'll follow the stars until the first light

Well I've been waiting for a compromise but guess its more the same
We've separated all the things that we want for gain

Why when men look outside do they see houses
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now, endeavor to free-fall
'Cause you can fall if you want to

It's just a matter of how far
You treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found

And it has been found wandering around
With that skipping rope, the trampoline

The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed

People that are in bondage both physically and emotionally
And eighty percent of these victims are women and children
Everyone's created in God's image and filled with His purpose
He doesn't see forty million as a number
He sees individuals that bear His image
And so we who have been rescued have a responsibility to rescue them

Family's stressed out times are hard
Cami desperate to find a job
Heard about work on the internet
Poor thing don't know cuz she innocent
So she meet up with dude at the mall
Told her come with me, girl you can have it all
So she hop in his fresh European
Naive, not knowing just what she'll be seeing
Homie done promised lil mama the world
Next introduced her to some of his girls
Showing her some things she don't even gotta know
Getting kinda late now she really wanna go
Little does she know, she in too deep
Something in her drink made her fall asleep
Nothing could've really prepared her for
What she would soon endure, cries come and rescue me

Rescue me
I'm lost and confused, I don't know what to do
Rescue me

Wanna be real in my faith
Wanna be real behind closed doors
Wanna be real on the stage
See the concern on my face
People will burn in the flames
God will consume all His enemies
No one escaping the penalty
Used to be fake as a Pharisee
Off on that Hennessy, messing with Stephanie
Show up to church and confess and be done with it
Never no punishment, loving the recipe
Bruh, I was dead in my sin
You ain't had nothin to say to me
Let me just do what I do
Leave me alone, man. Just pray for me
Loved my sinning
Living without no limits
Wickedness indiscriminate
Prison of my volition, till
Someone witnessed
Holy Spirit convicted
Born again, y'all I'm risen
Sanctified and forgiven, but uh
I got a feeling that some of y'all listening
Don't even know the condition you're in
What I told you that God up in Heaven
Can send you to Hell or forgive you of sin
You believe me though?
God came down to redeem His own
Broke the chains, now I'm free to go
Tell the world what they need to know

Need to know
Need to know

Born to gaze into night skies
All you want is one more Saturday
But look here, until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air
And your feet in the fetters till the day
We come in doing cartwheels.
We all cut out by ourselves,
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes.

You'd be damned to be one of us girl,
Faced with the dodo's conundrum:
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried.

I really don't care
Ain't got no paper in my pockets now
But I will, I swear

Honey, I know you're tired of losing
It's a million to one, I know
Put your lily hand in mine
This is the ballad of a patient man

Lift your heart!

Lift your tired eyes now darling

No one saw your family photo album

Could you buy a new drink for the old drunk
It's no crime to resign misery with a bottle
You walked into town without making a sound
As you slipped and you slammed your face into the crowd
As you tried to forget all the words that were said
To deny all the things that you keep in your head

When you came you were new but today you're much older
You were spent so you went to get used in the corner
Where they kicked you around like a rodeo clown
As it echoed through town they were beating you down
And as the the word then spread that you liked how it hurt

It was still like kind of a long builder but it was more...
The sounds were more contemporary, I think
It was less of a vintage-sounding thing

There's a rabble on the loose
We had ourselves one hell of a time
Tearing up the town with you

We got ourselves some stories
Took a wrong turn or two (just one or two)
We made ourselves a whole load of friends
One night only then we're on the move

Fair winds and following seas
Thank you for the memories
Fair winds and following seas
I know we'll meet again somewhere

Where everything was exactly how it seemed
Where there was never any mystery of who shot John F. Kennedy
It was just a man with something to prove
Slightly bored and severely confused
He steadied his rifle with his target in the center
And became famous on that day in November

Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in
Don't wake me I plan on sleeping
Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in

Us Boston boys, alas are few
Some from crosstown some from the coast
To give our skipper one last toast
We'll pour the good stuff
Round his casket
Drop some coin into the basket
Bow our heads
and praise the Lord
Then rouse ourselves and strike a chord...

Lets raise a glass and lift it up
Then sip from Jimmy Collins Cup
And hail the lads that won the crown
While turning baseball upside down

We hit them hard,
We hit them clean

Walking away to come back alive
I miss the easiness in me
And I'm finding it hard to barely breathe

I long to strum a simple song
That tracks me back to days of gone
When sisters and brothers knew
That love was the thing to do

Pining am I for some piece of time
When the hands wind down and sit still
Where all I know can unfold and recline
Washed over my mind, there will

I know there will be (I know there will be)

So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's cliche the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 lists
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Two ranch homes, both dockside
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide

And rip the skin right off my mouth
There seems to be a problem with the main connection
Someone's torn the wires out

Stuck in a place where all the teachers can't be trusted
Everything revolves around their appetite

Decisions become more abnormal
The more attention it gets paid
I'm the number one supporter of the first edition
With all the original errors made

Something started happening to the people I love
None of them have spoken to me since
The way they used to back when I was just a little boy
It's different

Rock 'n' roll music itching to fight
Makin' love drunk or stoned
Lookin' for dollars, get broken-boned
It's a game too tough to tame

No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

Phantasmal myriads of sane bucolic birth

Focus on the skyline, read the silhouettes
Your deepest desires are a picture of tomorrow
All your darkest fears are just a vestige of regret

And it's woah-oh-oh-oh
It seems like such a long way to go
As obstacles get bigger, prevailing winds blow stronger
And the fire continues to grow

Don't let shallow water limit your perception
Heed the new horizon, muster to it fast
The moments of your yesterdays are in the wake behind you

Dope so good, a silky smooth perfume

Ride my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand

You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

Mind my simple song, this ain't gonna work

Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human

I sit in the car and I listen to static

I wanna get some house lights on these -------
Can we do that?

If I say, I don't need anyone, I can say these things to you
'Cause, I can turn on any one just like I turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors but then you'll do whatever I like

'Cause here I am
And you're a rocket queen, oh, yeah
I might be a little young
But honey, I ain't naive
Here I am
And you're a rocket queen, oh, yeah

They were always seeking but they'll never find
That it's alright, and it's alright

It's always been that way and it can never be
Well, it's alright, and it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That it's alright, and it's alright

This is a song about unrequited love
Dizzy

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same?
Ooh, yeah

'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh, yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go

I don't turn around to see who let one ring out
Said you'll never do me wrong?
Guess we see how that plays out
Is it true? Is it true?

Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
Look at those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out
Let it ring out
Let it ring out

Sick of this head of mine
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze

You cried on my shoulder
Goodbye

You said it was over

Come on
This hurts like hell
But I keep telling myself
It's gonna get better
But it's taking forever
I try to go out
But every time I leave the house
Something reminds me
Of what's now behind me
Every day I let go just a little bit more

In the end, I'm gonna be alright
But it might take a hundred sleepless nights

897,253978356,"So I was right
You were too good to be true
Was this love fulfilling?
Or did I just fill my void like a fool, yes?
That final night
When you said, ""Damn, I'll miss you""
I believed it, didn't I?
'Cause it felt like the right thing to do

'Cause it feels like I owe you for all those years of happiness you brought me
You gave me that, so I'll give you that
Not one thing that I would take back

I love you so much
Thank you for having me

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way?

I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid

So I put on those old heeled boots, they've been waiting
At the bottom of the closet alone

I can't behave, but I don't want to be alone

I caught you on the couch, you were having a fright all alone
With the TV on
Clothes strewn on the floor, I got down on my knees
You told me everything that you wanted to be all along
Was it wrong?

And I said, ""Listen, oh, I know it's been a long, long year
But I think we should go and get you out of here""
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
Pack up all your shit and put it in the back
Maybe the miles can make up for the things you lack

I'm praying to the headlights like I prayed to you

Esta noche Grupo Firme mandando saludos a nuestra gente de
Tijuana, Guadalajara, Michoacán, Guerrero
Dice más o menitos el Corrido del Barco
Puro M-P Tres, Culiacán, viejo

La pobreza me tocó desde morrillo, pero así le sale al toro
Por las calles de Tijuana navegaba como un barco en altamar

Desde plebe empecé a chambear
Tirando motita y cristal
La necesidad fue más grande que el miedo, me gustó ganarme el peso

Diez años en el negocio, altas, bajas pero siempre fui aprendiendo
A los 26 cumplidos, a Guanatos mi navío fue a parar

Ahí me puse a cocinar
Pura meta de calidad

Tres hermanos que el cariño me brindaban

Una cáscara con mis amigos, como lo disfrutaba

La familia se destrozó en un instante
Mas de pronto me quedaba sin mi padre
Me tiré pa California en Spring Valley

Fui cocinero, también jardinero, había que atorarle

I'm somebody you use, but never own
I'm somebody you touch, but never hold
And you're somebody I'll never really know

I know I'm not the one you really love
I guess that's why I've never given up
'Cause I could give you all you want, the stars and the sun
But still, I'm not enough

Oh-oh, all I really wanted was that look in your eyes
Like you already know that I'm the love of your life
Like you already know you're never sayin' goodbye

Without Autotune in the back these days
Well fuck that! I got somethin to say
With brown blunts, green weed and the smoke is grey, see (Heeeey!)
The best to do it was Roger Troutman
Nah shorty, T-Pain didn't come out then!
I was about ten, had striped Adidas
Raised from the back in the days, all types of leaders
Now, I'm like DANG, they sound the same
Buck voice is original, he authored reigns
Dr. J, Barry White, WHOA!
Or Barry Manilow, the flow like DAG he nice
So, keep that original flow
That ""Bucktown"", Duck Down, that shit you know.

Big fridges that could fit ten midgets
Damn, they rich, hey, she left me fifty dishes, bitch

Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you

I'll run right over to shove some dirt right down your throat
It's nothing I have against you
You're just a creep and you can't remember the last five years

What's a bond if it dissolves in water?
I took a piss that lasted longer than you and your manipulations
Called my mom last night
She said, ""Sweetie, you don't need someone
who's more fleeting than fall""

Don't you love those leaves?
Don't you wish the orange stayed forever?
And crickets sang in the night
All through winter

Was that night we watched
Documentaries up through morning
Then you kicked me out—huh
You opened up your screen door
And threw me out on the porch
It was summer then
And I drove home whistling
Down the pike, yeah

And that was that
Our one sweet night together
And under highway signs
I watched our love start fluttering

The wrong way round, looking out the window.
It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road
We saw elvis - look, there beside the postman's van,
And he was walking round the postman's van,
Looking in the open door.

He looked as if he was thinking about getting in,
But then the postman came back,
And he swaggered off,
Walked past the window and down the stairs,
And then at the bottom of the stairs right
By the caretaker's office,
He started licking the pavement.

Every night now since we moved in that new house
There's this noise outside the door at just about half seven
Or eight o' clock every night.

And if we go and look outside the door,
Elvis'll be standing there waiting to be let in.
And then he wanders into the living room,
Maybe sits down on one of the chairs
Or even lies down on the floor.

He doesn't say much,
He just stays there for an hour or two, watching the tv.
We talk to him a bit,
And then around ten o' clock, he'll go away again,

I've been looking round the town
For somebody just like me

Are the dummies in the window
They spend their money on clothes
It saddens me to think
That the only ones I see are mannequins
Looking stupid, being used and being thin
And I don't know why I hang around with them
The way they act, I'd rather be fat than be confused
The way they act, I'd rather be fat than be confused
Than be me in a cage
With a bottle of rage

She took the shortcut
To being fully grown

She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose

Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It's time you get your fingers what
The last I heard from you,
You were screaming ""handle it""

I will tell you a story

This story is about a big big man
And a small small man that made him
Small man says, ""Oh big man, in all your greatness
What can I do for you?
I beg o, give me job now
Let me work eighty hours a week to make money
So I can give the same money back to you, big man
When I buy your beautiful products""

This is the system

Small man!

How to make big man big
How to make small man small
Make themselves small man helpless
Too weak to carry power
Making your big man better
Making your big man smarter
Making your big man deserve
Small man go clean yansh for am

Big man!

Making him be politician
Big man he be business business
Control the bank plenty money
Him offer you credits and credit
Him offer you mortgage payment
Or make you indentured servant
Deserve to pay back my money
And deserve more than you

Trying to knock my peace
Standing bold as brass and i'm holding fast
Molded by the king on throne
Singing praises, brazen as we bring on home, sling and stone

Finally awoke and
Everything's comin' into focus
Widescreen's up
Got that big picture
I am not gonna waste another moment
I've got everything I need
I don't have anything to worry 'bout
As long as I'm His
I am confident
That it's all good and I'm going all-out

Yes I really do believe
That I'm gonna be what he says I will be
No doubts in the will at all
The writing's on the wall
Following the plan y'all
Targeted by that ole' boy but I ain't backing down
No sir I am not playin'
Microphones like a sling 'n stone
Out here winnin' for the kingdom
BOLD

Yeah, it was written in the books of europeans we were
Savage
That our history was insignificant and minds below
Average
But how can one diminish the work
Of the most imitated culture on this earth
Fast foward to 2000 and now
You see it everywhere you look, speech, music, fasion
And style
It's black dialogue
Go ahead kid, try it on
It's much harder to master than precision with
Firearms
Corny niggaz switch it up and rent it to viacom
But it was taught to me early on by my mom
Master yourself, for maximum outreach potential
Respect that you get from that will roll exponential
Preferential treatment, brings us heat when
It only goes to those who rock the diamonds and
Sequence
They invite the kiddies to the video show
To watch the fake titty models all act like hoes
I guessed it goes the more ignorants the more pressed
But everywhere i look i see black people with more
Stress
But does that mean we should be shucking and jiving
Fucking and kniving just to keep our bank accounts
Thriving
See i walked the path my elder laid out
Cause acting like a monkey for white folks is played
Out

We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing!

How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
and you showed up with a gun to load up
Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
Now you're weighing many lives against yours
President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
of a sniper's shaky scared, shot of your ear
All fucked up now! one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pops
Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
(Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart

Well, posing for pictures and living on a poster
The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure
I ain't always happy, and I ain't always sad
But when the spotlight is on, you have to handle the task
And even the people who swear they love so bad
A go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags
Then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh

Your man watch as your whole head opens up
Sober up, niggy, it's the Bob Digi
We throw darts in the air that float like a frisbee
My neck is frostbitten, glass wouldn't teach me
Love my wares but y'all thug niggas miss me
I'm bionic, my chronic draw the Digi-juice
My fist stacks is bruce you better call the jukes
No excuse the black man must stand up
Time to make the Wu sign throw both of y'all hands up
You see me in a Maserati GranTurismo
Up in the club my beat got more sub than Quizno
Mama that's the business I'ma a get this

Then he takes your hand
In some strange Californian handshake
And breaks the bone

Breaks and makes a 'U' and idles back

Rarely threw my hat into the crowd
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning

Used to look in on the children at night
In the glow of their Donald Duck light
And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning

But, oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning
Oh, oh, oh, the tide is turning

Satellite buzzing through the endless night
Exclusive to moonshots and world title fights
Jesus Christ imagine what it must be earning

Who is the strongest

And I spent all week wearing the same old clothes
See, two months is way too long to be here
Stuck in a room

I figured I would switch it up
And rearrange my house
I moved around a bunch of stuff
I even slept on the couch
I slept on the floor, and uh, wait for it
I even built a goddamn fort
But ain't nothing feeling new 'cause I'm still
Stuck in a room

Now I can't sleep, and I can't sit still

White Bent Light Tint Ridin Like WTF Is An Indictment
Spend Ten Thous For Excitement
Thats How The Day Goes Thats How The Niqhts Went
Louis Baqs Balenciagas the Ones Talked About By The Fashion Bloqqers,
You Know Me Imma Murcielaga In The Same Lime Green As The Air Max Troggers,
But If It Wasnt Here Will She Wanna Go
You Dont Wanna Ask But You Wanna Know,
Will My Baby Weather The Storm
Stick Around Till The Weather Is Warm Heyy

When The Money Goes Will The Honeys Stay
When The Gray Skies Replace The Sunny Days
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey

Yo, I blacks out, I pulls the MAC out
Scream ""What's that about?"", then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
Feeling it, feeling it, chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me, ""Turn the beat off""
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire

I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
And rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, 'til the end of the road
I'm cynical when in the view of the public, and this is because
I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

Can I live
For all my niggas with the all-white Air Force Ones and black guns
Stack ones, yo
Can I live
For all my chicks, pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like the bulldog
Know what I mean?

Can I live
To all the cee-lo champs

Huey Love in the house, long Posdnuos, Dove, Prince Paul, the
Immigrant Lucien in the house. The house Dreddy Bear, ha, Mike G!

A Nubian sprocket is the one
Plug One, cut the cap
Forward is the marcher of the chant
To the clan, unless you slept
Willy to the Wonka of the feast
Smoke your blunt, but close your drapes
If we get fined by police
Don't worry, yo, I got the papes
Toxic is the talk that I tell
Tell the tales from the lady who's fat
Chris made the dope beat but no Bo Peeps
(And you can't beat that with a baseball bat)

Come on everybody let's baseball

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on everybody let's baseball

Your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm

When the solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet
Between the black skies, and my red eyes, I can barely see
When I realize I've been sold out by my friends and my family
I can feel the rain reminding me

And I'm runnin' out of faith
I see the future, I picture, slowly fade away
And when the tears of pain and heartache
Are pouring down my face
I find my peace in Jesus' name

As I watch your children grow
And the years them carry on
And I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school
And tell them what dem fi know
All of mi friend dem mi salute
Daddi gon and Lenny Screw
Another year has come and past
Man a drop like morning dew
Uncle Warrick sick and gone
When him couldn't catch a flu
Picka T you a mi don
Respect long and overdue
When nothing never did a gwan
You still have on somethin' new
Our friendship ever last
All when one minus from few
Yes we surely had a blast
We're like family, me and you
A nuh every path you cross
Lead to somebody whe true
Of the many that are called
Only chosen is a few

Of the real friends that serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain
Your real friends will serve you long
Acquaintances will fade
Your real friends won't do you wrong

And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world

And I'll see you through

Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or sitting with goons in a visiting room
Flip it, I could've been you
Behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for
Or a shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall

I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called

Jah told you in his own words

When the solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet
Between the black skies and my red eyes I can barely see
When i realize i've been sold out by my friends and my family
I can feel the rain reminding me

In the eye of the storm you remain in control
In the middle of the war you guard my soul
You alone are the anchor
When my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me
In the eye of the storm

When my hopes and dreams are far from me and i'm running out of faith
I see the future I pictured slowly fade away
And when the tears of pain and heartache are pouring down my face
I find my peace in Jesus' name

Don't know 'bout you, but I'm fed up
Can you tell me where we messed up?
We say that we wanna change it
But really we don't wanna face it
I don't know if I can take it

Can we learn to open up our blind eyes

Chains and colors marching into the night

My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot

I got you right where I want
Got an honest face so you turn your back
When in doubt, run up your attack

At one time you were slick and your grill was cold
And now funny how the shit gets old
You can run, you can run but it will catch up
Like now see me, I'll show you up

Now you wanna get back when you had your shine
But you run, you can run but it will catch up
Like now see me I'll show you up

Now you wanna get back when you had your shine
But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme
Can't stop, won't stop, no compromise
It's a house of cards built out of lies

Coming down like a bird floating on the mist
Turn on the track, back track and twist
You work hard to climb the list
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift

I know the danger of a man
(That's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again

I'm gone in a flick, but back in a second
With salted skin, rash for no reason
Boys are loading their arms, girls gasp with envy
F-f-for whom are they mimicking endlessly?
Same old sadness in small lumps on my jaw
For lusting after is the usual freak show
May your girl come, birdie die under this spur
F-f-fingers angrily sunk on the jugular, then

Girlfriend
Don't feel like a girlfriend
But lover?
Damn, I'd be your lover

My hardest times
Hardest times
My Hardest times

Add us up together
Atmospheres are level
[?] forever
Your love like a pepper

I'm hot (wooh)

Jalapeno, oh darlin
Why'd you burn me

Yo! Para-diso inferno solo un dito in ascensore,
dopo cielo quando salto sto due ore in sospensione,
prima fiamme tra le tenebre rivedo il colore,
l'inferno è un padre il paradiso non ha genitore,
eri così dolce quando mi toglievi il fiato,
ma intendo proprio nell'istante in cui mi hai accoltellato,
chi sbaglia paga la tua lama trova weeda e un vodka lemon quando gira nella piaga,
mi trovi cambiato? (L'hai detto tu che io sono cambiato),
più provi a costruir qualcosa e passi per montato,
più passi per montato lo rismonti quel qualcosa,
va a finire che non chiedi mani per finire il puzzle,
resti da solo è solo un attimo mio little boy,
sogni di passare da 'sta merda a un attico a Detroit,
fatti il tetto in vetro che la fuori è pieno di avvoltoi,

And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy

Now you sayin it's shame on me
You left with a chick with a set of double D's
Why should we separate like Siamese
Didn't anybody tell you sex better in threes
I can be the reason that you both knock kneed
If I tell my homie Zulee he wouldn't knock me
Try to tell me lies, but you're so sloppy
When you leave with your friends, they all jock me
I understand if she know how to please you
I understand if she lovin' And tease You
In my right mind I should probably leave you
Why can't all three of us be peoples

Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me)

Made with adrenaline
Seeping out through the skin
Like only lovers could
Here's where we begin
Time is the medicine
To heal these needs
That only raise our voices

Higher, higher
Tonight we raise the dead
Tonight we bury this in fire, fire
Under the shape of years
And the weight that brought us here

But we can separate
To form these hearts in stone
Rewrite this pain we own
Caught here in the wake
Nothing but genuine

Second piece

Sexism isn't over

Since we're in this room together in this magical place
We can participate in something
The ancient Greeks called catharsis
Y'all might know of it as group therapy
We're all gonna feel something together
And maybe shed a little bit of the bullshit

So at the end of the song I'm going to call to you
And that's your chance to either sing or scream
And shed that bullshit
And it can be a parking ticket or kids in cages
But we're gonna shed some of it

Bullshit
Y'all ready to learn it?
Some of that bull shit

So y'alls part will be
Bull shit yeah that's bull shit
(Bull shit yeah that's bull shit)

One more

Y'all sound like you're hot and tired

Get down on your knees and tell me all the things you're sorry for

Crack in the sock, just a rebel with a hand full of rocks
Cadillac on D's, like Pamela Anderson's top
Had to have a knot to fill a void from not having a pops
See, his old man was a dope head, never had J's, just PRO-Keds
Mother worked all kind of jobs, broke her back tryna provide
But the local smack dealers outside who he idolized
When they bang, the disciple signs light up the night like fireflies
He wanna be them
So he gotta be in, anything to numb the pain
Only twelve, serving fiends, soaking in the pouring rain

And I hope that we can face this together
Any city, every weather

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise

With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Down by the shore, a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
You left before I come to

Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin'
I think I'm in love again, found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative (narrative)

I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that, dick in her mouth all day
She take that, dick in her mouth all day
She said she wanted my, wanted my
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I give her that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (love again)

Here I am my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal

1291,74478946,"Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose
I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent
The median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold

Authorities have spoken
Demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground
While the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano
Y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery
Stuck in me automatic

I'll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who'll swim
Like directly after he's eaten
While holdin' a toaster oven
That's plugged with a fork in it
'Cause death by electrocution's like
Life in New York, innit?

Shoulda been a dentist, Mom said it
Pains the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors
That I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop, I can chop it up
With exacto touch, what's the rush?

Autograph skin flaps, tag 'em up
I don't brag enough, you defacto suck, hey
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu

1292,198336827,"I woke up early once again that's four days straight
I didn't wake you baby, I just watched you lay
In the radiation of the city sun
I am in love with you, it is my only grace (woo)
You know how everything can seem a little out of place?

All of my life that's seemed to be the only normal state
So feelin' normal never really meant me feelin' sane
And bein' clear about the truth and
Bein' sane have never really been the same
I used to wanna get the chance to show the world I'm smart (ha)
Isn't that dumb? I should've focused mostly on the heart

'Cause I seen smarter people trample life like it's a heart
So bein' smart ain't what it used to be, that's fuckin' dark
You ever notice that the worst of us have all the chips?
It really kinda takes the sheen how people getting rich
Like maybe rich is not the holy ever lovin' king of nothin' fuckers
Know we know you're bluffin'
You are dealing with the motherfuckin' money-money runners

It'd be a lie if I told you that I ever disdained the fortune and fame
But the presence of the pleasure
Never abstained me from any of the pain
When my mother transitioned to another plane, I was sitting on a plane
Tellin' her to hold on and she tried hard but she just couldn't hang
Been two years, truth is I'll probably never be the same

Dead serious, it's a chore not to let myself go insane

1293,198336822,"Get a dose of dirty code to go, been cold since Co-Flow
I got wire or two unlodgin', I'll set a fire down below
I'll hang it up when you say, ""sorry, I didn't know""
Prolly got a year or ten to go, so let's go
I don't really know how to go slow
Just got done walkin' in the snow

Goddamn, that motherfucker's cold (Ayy)
You in the wrong mode, you open and closin' your hole, it's a no go
This whole world's a shit moat, filled to the brim like GitMo
When you think it don't get mo' low it limbo 'til the sticks on flo'
All oppression's born of lies, I don't make the rules, I'm just one guy
All due respect, if getting spit on's how respect is now defined

Hungry for truth but you got screwed and drank the Kool-Aid, there's a line
It end directly at the edge of a mass grave, that's their design
Funny fact about a cage, they're never built for just one group
So when that cage is done with them and you're still poor, it come for you
The newest lowest on the totem, well golly gee, you have been used
You helped to fuel the death machine that down the line will kill you too (oops)

Pseudo-Christians, y'all indifferent
Kids in prisons ain't a sin? shit
If even one scrap a what Jesus taught connected, you'd feel different
What a disingenuous way to piss away existence, I don't get it
I'd say you lost your goddamn minds if y'all possessed one to begin with

Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold (Cold, cold)

I cannot keep you out my brain

All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ay
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ay

Baby, won't you come my way?

Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know
